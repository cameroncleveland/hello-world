Vicka: “We saw many people in hell. Many are there already, and many more will go there when they die…The Blessed Mother says that those people who are in hell are there because they chose to go there. They wanted to go to hell…We all know that there are persons on this earth who simply don’t admit that God exists, even though He helps them, gives them life and sun and rain and food. He always tries to nudge them onto the path of holiness. They just say they don’t believe, and they deny Him. They deny Him, even when it is time to die. And they continue to deny Him, after they are dead. It is their choice. It is their will that they go to hell. They choose hell.

The purpose of the research project is for the students to learn how to formulate a simple natural language problem/task/application and to experience how to solve it using methods, algorithms and techniques taught in class. The students will conduct experimental evaluation on an interesting dataset and will analyze the obtained results. Students are encouraged to identify new problems/tasks/applications, however we will also provide them with a sample of topics. Building a demo is optional, but will count as bonus points. We strongly encourage the students to work in groups of 2 people.
