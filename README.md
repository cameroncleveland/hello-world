I like Games Guns, and Gardening. I would not could not with a goat on a boat eat green eggs and ham!

The purpose of the research project is for the students to learn how to formulate a simple natural language problem/task/application and to experience how to solve it using methods, algorithms and techniques taught in class. The students will conduct experimental evaluation on an interesting dataset and will analyze the obtained results. Students are encouraged to identify new problems/tasks/applications, however we will also provide them with a sample of topics. Building a demo is optional, but will count as bonus points. We strongly encourage the students to work in groups of 2 people.
